### //deprecation notice//

Please see the following **shadow-cljs** example of compiling dependencies for self-hosted ClojureScript: https://github.com/mhuebert/shadow-bootstrap-example


([shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs/) now has built-in support for compiling and loading self-host dependencies. This means the build script of cljs-live is no longer required nor recommended.)
